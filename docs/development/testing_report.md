# API Test Report

## 1. Introduction

This report provides a comprehensive summary of the testing phase for the Omoai API. It covers the API's structure, the testing methodology employed, the results of the tests, and the resolution of a critical bug discovered during the process. The purpose of this report is to document the API's stability and readiness for deployment.

## 2. API Structure Summary

The Omoai API is designed to provide a modular and scalable service for audio processing. The core logic is located in `src/omoai/api/`, with key components including:

- **`app.py`**: The main application file that sets up the FastAPI application and includes the routers.
- **Controllers**: `main_controller.py`, `preprocess_controller.py`, `asr_controller.py`, and `postprocess_controller.py` define the API endpoints and handle incoming requests.
- **`models.py`**: Defines the data models used for request and response validation.
- **`services.py`**: Contains the business logic for each processing step.

The API exposes the following endpoints:

- `GET /`: A welcome endpoint to confirm the API is running.
- `GET /health`: A health check endpoint to monitor the API's status.
- `POST /preprocess`: Preprocesses an audio file to prepare it for ASR.
- `POST /asr`: Performs Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) on a preprocessed audio file.
- `POST /postprocess`: Postprocesses the ASR results to improve readability and format.
- `POST /pipeline`: Executes the full preprocessing, ASR, and postprocessing pipeline in a single call.

## 3. Testing Methodology

The testing strategy involved a combination of unit and integration tests to ensure comprehensive coverage of the API's functionality.

- **Unit Tests**: Focused on isolating and testing individual components, primarily the services in `src/omoai/api/services.py`. These tests are located in `tests/test_api_services.py`.
- **Integration Tests**: Designed to test the complete workflow of the API endpoints, from receiving a request to returning a response. These tests, located in `tests/test_api_integration_real.py`, use real audio files to simulate production scenarios and cover various error conditions.

## 4. Test Results

The testing phase yielded excellent results, demonstrating the robustness of the API.

- **Total Tests**: 21
- **Unit Tests**: 11
- **Integration Tests**: 10
- **Pass Rate**: 100%

All tests passed successfully, indicating that the API is functioning as expected under both normal and error conditions.

## 5. Bugs and Resolutions

During the integration testing phase, a critical bug was identified in the `/pipeline` endpoint.

- **Bug**: The endpoint was not correctly parsing query parame[text](.)ters, leading to incorrect behavior when processing requests.
- **Root Cause**: The issue was traced back to a parameter handling error in `src/omoai/api/main_controller.py`.
- **Resolution**: The code was updated to correctly parse and handle the query parameters, resolving the issue. This fix was validated by the integration test suite.

This issue has been resolved and documented in the project's technical debt analysis.

## 6. Conclusion

The comprehensive testing of the Omoai API, including both unit and integration tests, has confirmed its stability and reliability. The 100% pass rate across all 21 tests, along with the successful resolution of a critical bug, demonstrates that the API is robust and ready for production use.
