# Best Practices for Post-Processing Scripts

This document outlines best practices for developing post-processing scripts for Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) output, based on industry standards and common patterns in Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning operations.

## 1. Punctuation Restoration

### Best Practices:

- **Model Selection**: Choose LLMs that are specifically fine-tuned for or have demonstrated strong performance on punctuation restoration and capitalization tasks. Models like T5, BART, or GPT-family models are often effective.
- **Prompt Engineering**: Use clear, well-structured prompts that provide the model with context and examples (few-shot learning) to improve punctuation accuracy.
- **Context Awareness**: Process text in chunks that maintain contextual coherence to improve the accuracy of punctuation placement, especially for longer documents.
- **Fallback Mechanisms**: Implement a fallback to rule-based punctuation if the LLM fails or returns an invalid response.
- **Evaluation**: Regularly evaluate the punctuation restoration quality using a labeled test set to measure the model's performance and identify areas for improvement.

### Implementation Guidelines:

- **Chunking Strategy**: When splitting text for processing, split at natural boundaries like sentence endings or paragraphs to maintain context.
- **Confidence Scoring**: Consider implementing a confidence score for the punctuation restoration to flag potentially low-quality segments for human review.
- **Hybrid Approaches**: Combine rule-based methods with LLM-based approaches for better accuracy. For example, use rules for common abbreviations and the LLM for more complex sentence structures.

## 2. Summarization

### Best Practices:

- **Abstractive vs. Extractive**: For most use cases, abstractive summarization (generating new sentences) provides more readable summaries than extractive summarization (selecting existing sentences).
- **Model Selection**: Use models fine-tuned for summarization tasks. For long documents, ensure the model has a sufficient context window or use map-reduce strategies.
- **Controlled Generation**: Use parameters like `max_length`, `min_length`, `temperature`, and `top_p` to control the length and creativity of the summary.
- **Quality Assessment**: Implement metrics like ROUGE, BLEU, or BERTScore to automatically evaluate the quality of generated summaries against human-written references.
- **User Control**: Allow users to specify the desired length, detail level, or focus of the summary (e.g., "bullet points," "executive summary").

### Implementation Guidelines:

- **Map-Reduce**: For long documents, the map-reduce approach is highly effective. It breaks the document into manageable chunks, summarizes each, and then combines the summaries.
- **Redundancy Reduction**: Implement logic to remove redundant information in the final summary, especially when using the map-reduce method.
- **Multi-Document Summarization**: If the application may need to summarize content from multiple sources, design the system to handle this from the beginning.

## 3. Text Chunking

### Best Practices:

- **Semantic Chunking**: Where possible, chunk text based on semantic meaning rather than a fixed number of words or tokens. This helps maintain context.
- **Overlap**: Introduce a small overlap between chunks to ensure that no information is lost at the boundaries.
- **Dynamic Chunking**: Adjust chunk size based on the complexity of the text or the requirements of the downstream task.
- **Content-Aware Chunking**: For transcripts, consider chunking based on speaker turns or pauses to maintain narrative flow.

### Implementation Guidelines:

- **Token Budgeting**: When using LLMs, always respect the model's token limit. Calculate token counts accurately, including the prompt.
- **Preserve Order**: Ensure that the order of chunks is maintained after processing, especially for tasks like punctuation restoration.
- **Boundary Detection**: Use punctuation, sentence boundaries, or other linguistic cues to identify natural breaking points for chunking.

## 4. Error Handling

### Best Practices:

- **Granular Exception Handling**: Catch specific exceptions (e.g., `requests.exceptions.Timeout`, `openai.error.RateLimitError`) rather than using a bare `except:`.
- **Retry Mechanisms**: Implement exponential backoff for transient errors like rate limiting or temporary network issues.
- **Graceful Degradation**: If a component fails, have a fallback mechanism that allows the system to continue with reduced functionality (e.g., skip summarization if the LLM is unavailable).
- **Logging**: Log all errors with sufficient detail (including stack traces for debugging) but without exposing sensitive information in user-facing messages.
- **User Communication**: Provide clear, user-friendly error messages that explain what went wrong and suggest possible actions.

### Implementation Guidelines:

- **Circuit Breaker Pattern**: Use a circuit breaker to prevent repeated calls to a failing service, which can help with rate limiting and system stability.
- **Validation**: Validate all inputs before processing them. Check for empty text, invalid formats, or values that are out of range.
- **Resource Management**: Ensure that all resources like file handles, network connections, and GPU memory are properly released, even in the event of an error.

## 5. Batching

### Best Practices:

- **Dynamic Batching**: Group requests to maximize throughput while respecting model constraints like maximum sequence length.
- **Batch Size Tuning**: Experiment with different batch sizes to find the optimal balance between GPU memory usage and processing speed.
- **Timeout Management**: Set appropriate timeouts for batch processing to prevent long-running jobs from blocking the system.
- **Progress Indication**: Provide users with clear progress indicators for long-running batch jobs.

### Implementation Guidelines:

- **Memory Management**: Be mindful of memory usage when batching, especially when dealing with large models or long sequences.
- **Asynchronous Processing**: For web applications or APIs, use asynchronous processing for batch jobs to avoid blocking user interfaces.
- **Result Ordering**: Ensure that the results are returned in the same order as the input requests to avoid confusion.

## 6. General Software Engineering Best Practices

- **Code Modularity**: Break down the script into small, reusable functions with a single responsibility.
- **Configuration Management**: Use configuration files or environment variables to manage settings, avoiding hardcoded values.
- **Type Hinting**: Use type hints to improve code readability, enable static type checking, and catch potential bugs early.
- **Documentation**: Document all functions, classes, and complex logic with clear docstrings and comments.
- **Testing**: Write unit tests and integration tests to ensure the reliability of the script. Mock external dependencies like LLM APIs for faster and more stable tests.
- **Version Control**: Use Git for version control and follow a branching strategy that supports development and maintenance.
- **Dependency Management**: Use a dependency manager like `pip` with a `requirements.txt` or `pyproject.toml` file to track and manage project dependencies.
- **Code Style**: Follow a consistent code style (e.g., PEP 8 for Python) to improve readability and maintainability.
