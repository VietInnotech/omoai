### BUG-001: CUDA Multiprocessing Fork Initialization Error [RESOLVED]

**Status**: ✅ Fixed
**Date**: 2025-09-12
**Component**: Post-processing pipeline
**Severity**: High

**Description**:
RuntimeError: "Cannot re-initialize CUDA in forked subprocess. To use CUDA with multiprocessing, you must use the 'spawn' start method"

**Root Cause**:
vLLM engine initialization in subprocess was failing because CUDA was already initialized in the parent process, and the default multiprocessing method on Linux ('fork') doesn't allow CUDA re-initialization.

**Impact**:

- Post-processing pipeline completely broken
- Affects all API calls that require punctuation/summarization
- Blocks entire audio processing workflow

**Fix Applied**:

1. Added multiprocessing spawn method enforcement in [`scripts/post.py`](scripts/post.py:11-13)
2. Enhanced CUDA isolation in [`src/omoai/api/scripts/postprocess_wrapper.py`](src/omoai/api/scripts/postprocess_wrapper.py:35-42)
3. Added comprehensive logging for diagnostics
4. Created unit tests to prevent regression

**Files Modified**:

- [`scripts/post.py`](scripts/post.py) - Added multiprocessing spawn method
- [`src/omoai/api/scripts/postprocess_wrapper.py`](src/omoai/api/scripts/postprocess_wrapper.py) - Enhanced CUDA isolation
- [`tests/test_cuda_multiprocessing_fix.py`](tests/test_cuda_multiprocessing_fix.py) - Regression tests

**Test Coverage**:

- ✅ Unit tests for multiprocessing spawn method
- ✅ CUDA context isolation tests
- ✅ Environment variable validation
- ✅ Full integration test suite passing

**Verification**:
All tests pass, including new CUDA multiprocessing compatibility tests. The fix ensures vLLM can initialize in subprocesses without CUDA conflicts.

## Previous Issues (Resolved)

### No Previous Issues

No previous issues - this is the first documented issue.

## Prevention Measures

1. **Automated Testing**: New unit tests prevent regression of CUDA multiprocessing issues
2. **Environment Validation**: Enhanced logging helps diagnose future CUDA-related issues
3. **Code Review**: All subprocess calls should now include proper CUDA isolation
4. **Documentation**: Updated troubleshooting guides with CUDA multiprocessing best practices

## Monitoring

- Monitor logs for "CUDA" and "multiprocessing" related warnings
- Watch for subprocess failures in post-processing pipeline
- Track performance impact of spawn vs fork methods
